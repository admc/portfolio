# portfolio

Hi ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my developer advocate portfolio! I've worked on everything from web properties, demo apps and videos, conference booths, talks, swag and more. I've spent most of my career focused on developer tooling and open source communities and it's been amazing.

## videos

- (Runme animated walkthrough)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR3xSrDo2KQ] (from Runme.dev): I worked with a contractor, but did all the messaging, outline, storyboard iterating, etc.
- (Runme in two minutes)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsb60yv1X7I]: A video I made to let users quickly understand a use case for Runme notebooks.
- (Stateful product walkthrough)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBScKadLE0w]: A video to show off what the Stateful collaboration product is and how it works.

## web properties

- I built (runme.dev)[https://runme.dev] (nextjs repo) and worked on the (docs)[https://docs.runme.dev] (docusaurus repo)
- I built (stateful.com)[https://stateful.com] (also next, using gql to pull blogs from hygraph)
